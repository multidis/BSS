Description: Efficient simulation of Brownian semistationary (BSS) processes, first introduced by
    Barndorff-Nielsen and Schmiegel (2009) <doi:10.1515/9783110213140.1>
    using the hybrid simulation scheme, as described in 
    Bennedsen, Lunde, Pakkannen (2017) <arXiv:1507.03004v4>, as well as functions to fit BSS processes
    to data, and functions to estimate the stochastic volatility process of a BSS process.
